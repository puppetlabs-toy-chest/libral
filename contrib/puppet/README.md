# Integrating Libral with Puppet

This folder contains a simple example of integrating Puppet with Libral, specifically exposing Libral providers to Puppet. This is not intended to be a complete solution, more at early working prototype.

You can see this working with the accompanying Dockerfile.The image contains both Puppet and Libral, along with Ralsh.

```
docker build -t puppet/puppet-libral-example .
```

Running this goes straight to running `puppet resource` for the new type.

```
$ docker run -it puppet/puppet-libral | head
Warning: Found multiple default providers for apt_libral: ralsh, simple; using ralsh
apt_libral { 'adduser':
  ensure   => '3.113+nmu3ubuntu4',
  platform => 'all',
}
apt_libral { 'apt':
  ensure   => '1.2.24',
  platform => 'amd64',
}
apt_libral { 'base-files':
```

Note above that Puppet detected two providers, one which uses ralsh and one which hits the provider directly. As part of the proof-of-concept you can force the usage of the `simple` provider with facter.

```
$ docker run -it -e FACTER_libral_provider=simple puppet/puppet-libral | head
apt_libral { 'adduser':
  ensure   => '3.113+nmu3ubuntu4',
  platform => 'all',
}
apt_libral { 'apt':
  ensure   => '1.2.24',
  platform => 'amd64',
}
apt_libral { 'base-files':
  ensure   => '9.4ubuntu4.5',
```

## Notes

* This only looks at `list` operations so far
* The types could be autogenerated from the libral providers, or loaded dynamically at runtime
* The providers are nearly 100% boilerplate, which should mean we can have a simple base class which does all the work for any libral provider
* The exception is type-specific fields, which again can be autogenerated or parsed from the provider/ralsh at runtime
* I've implemented both a simple provider and a ralsh provider. A JSON provider would be simple enough, and once https://github.com/puppetlabs/libral/pull/25 is working it should be possible to use the native Ruby interface. I'm doing this for completeness, in reality we'd probably pick one
