# Building libral

This file describes how to build `libral` from source. You should follow
the first set of instructions as much as possible as the instructions for
building a static executable are much more hairy.

## Building on Fedora

These instructions work on Fedora 24 and 25. They should also work on other
Linux distros if you adjust for differences in package names.

### Install needed packages

```bash
    dnf -y install gcc-c++ cmake make gettext boost-devel    \
      curl-devel yaml-cpp-devel augeas-devel ruby rake bison \
      rubygem-bundler rubygem-yard rubygem-rake-compiler     \
      ruby-devel redhat-rpm-config
```

You will also need to have `ruby` and `rake` installed, as the embedded
build of `mruby` needs these tools; the versions aren't very important,
anything recent and supported should suffice. They are only needed at build
time, not at runtime.

### Build Leatherman

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/leatherman.git
    cd leatherman
    git checkout 1.0.0
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
```

### Build libral

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/libral
    cd libral
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

You can now run `ralsh` with

```bash
    source ./bin/dev  # Sets a number of environment variables
    ./bin/ralsh
    ./bin/ralsh user
    ./bin/ralsh user root
```

## Building a static executable on CentOS6

It is currently not possible to build a static executable on CentOS/Fedora,
as those distros do not ship some key static libraries such as
`augeas-static`, `libicu-static`, and `yamlcpp-static`. The best way to
build a static executable is therefore to use the
[`pl-build-tools`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pl-build-tools-vanagon)
toolchain, which sadly is only available internally at Puppet (or you can
build your own from
[this repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pl-build-tools-vanagon)).

Assuming you have that toolchain, you need to do the following:

### Install needed packages

```bash
      rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-6.noarch.rpm
      rpm -ivh http://$INTERNAL_HOST_FOR_PL_BUILD_TOOLS/yum/el/6/x86_64/pl-build-tools-release-22.0.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
      yum -y install puppet-agent pl-boost pl-cmake pl-yaml-cpp pl-gcc
      yum -y install zlib-static libselinux-static readline-static ncurses-static
```

You will also need to have `ruby` and `rake` installed, as the embedded
build of `mruby` needs these tools; the versions aren't very important,
anything recent and supported should suffice. They are only needed at build
time, not at runtime. A simple way to achieve this, is to use the Ruby that
comes with `puppet-agent` by appending `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin` to your
`PATH`.

### Build Leatherman

```bash
    # This alias will be used a couple of times
    alias pl-cmake='/opt/pl-build-tools/bin/cmake \
           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
           -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/pl-build-tools/pl-build-toolchain.cmake \
           -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/pl-build-tools \
           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/puppetlabs/puppet'
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/leatherman.git
    cd leatherman
    git checkout 1.0.0
    mkdir build && cd build
    pl-cmake -DBOOST_STATIC=ON ..
    make
    sudo make install
```

### Build libral

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/libral
    cd libral
    mkdir build && cd build
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/pkgconfig \
      pl-cmake -DLIBRAL_STATIC=ON ..
    make
    # Put everything into one place so it can be easily copied
    # into VM's or containers
    ../examples/dpack
```

## Building in Docker

One additional option is to use a container-based build environment, allowing
you to build and test libral on any platform that supports Docker.

### Build and run container image

```bash
    docker build -t libral-build examples
    docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/usr/src/libral libral-build
```

You will now have a bash command-line running inside the top-level source
directory (inside a Fedora container), and you can build and run `libral`
as described above. Source code changes and the build/ directory will remain
on the Docker host even after the Docker container is destroyed.

## Building on OS X

Libral builds successfully with Clang 5.0+ and libraries installed with the
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager.

### Install packages (homebrew)

```bash
    brew install cmake boost openssl libxml2 yaml-cpp augeas
```

You will also need to have `ruby` and `rake` installed, as the embedded
build of `mruby` needs these tools; the versions aren't very important,
anything recent and supported should suffice. They are only needed at build
time, not at runtime.

### Build Leatherman

Follow the same instructions as building on Linux.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/leatherman.git
    cd leatherman
    git checkout 1.0.0
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
```

### Build libral

Again, following the same instructions as Linux.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/libral
    cd libral
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

## Go Package

[![Go Docs Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/puppetlabs/libral/libralgo?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/puppetlabs/libral/libralgo) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/puppetlabs/libral)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/puppetlabs/libral)

The `github.com/puppetlabs/libral/libralgo` package provides a initial Go binding
to the native libral C++ library, it binds to methods exposed by the `cwrapper.cc`
'C' interface.

Currently the Go package has a build constraint applied to restrict its use to
Linux.

###Â Building example Go client

An sample Go client which uses the `github.com/puppetlabs/libral/libralgo` package
is provided along with a container-based build environment which builds upon the
existing `libral-build` image.

You can build the example client (`examples/go/listproviders.go`) as follows:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/libral
    cd libral/contrib/docker
    make el6-build-static-go
    cd ../../
    docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/libral libral/el6-build-static-go
```

This will place the built binary and a packaged archive (based on `statpack`) in the
`build/go-example` directory of your local libral workspace.
